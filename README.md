# Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis and Recommendations for Reduction

### Background

In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.

### Work

This project revises the preliminary conclusions based on statistical inference. The appropriate hypothesis is chosen and tested.

Besides the initial visualization, a more direct way to convey the information visually is provided.
